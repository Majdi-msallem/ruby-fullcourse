*Partials:
    -are way for breaking the rendering process into more manageable chunks. with a partial , you can move the code 
    for rendering a particular piece of a response to its own file 

    -To render a partial as part of a view you need to use  the render method within the view  
                ex: <%=render 'form'%>
