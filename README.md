# Controllers in Ruby on Rails

Controllers in Ruby on Rails are responsible for handling incoming requests, processing data, and rendering appropriate views. They serve as the intermediary between the user's browser and the application's models and views.

## Creating a Controller

Controllers are typically created using the Rails command-line interface (CLI) tool. For example, to generate a `PostsController`, you would run:

```bash
rails generate controller Posts
```

This command will generate the controller file (`app/controllers/posts_controller.rb`) along with corresponding views and routes.

## Actions

Controllers consist of various actions, each corresponding to a specific HTTP request method (e.g., GET, POST, PUT, DELETE). Common actions include:

- `index`: Display a list of resources.
- `show`: Display a specific resource.
- `new`: Display a form to create a new resource.
- `create`: Create a new resource.
- `edit`: Display a form to edit an existing resource.
- `update`: Update an existing resource.
- `destroy`: Delete a resource.

```ruby
class PostsController < ApplicationController
  def index
    @posts = Post.all
  end

  def show
    @post = Post.find(params[:id])
  end

  # Other actions...
end
```

## Strong Parameters

Rails controllers often use strong parameters to specify which parameters are allowed to be used in mass assignment (e.g., when creating or updating records).

```ruby
class PostsController < ApplicationController
  # ...

  def create
    @post = Post.new(post_params)
    if @post.save
      redirect_to @post
    else
      render 'new'
    end
  end

  private

  def post_params
    params.require(:post).permit(:title, :body)
  end
end
```

## Rendering Views

Controllers render views using the `render` method. By default, Rails will render views with the same name as the action.

```ruby
class PostsController < ApplicationController
  # ...

  def show
    @post = Post.find(params[:id])
    render 'show'
  end

  # ...
end
```

## Resources

For RESTful resources, Rails provides the `resources` method in routes.rb, which automatically generates routes for the standard CRUD actions.

```ruby
Rails.application.routes.draw do
  resources :posts
end
```

This is a basic overview of controllers in Ruby on Rails. They play a crucial role in handling requests and coordinating the flow of data in Rails applications.
